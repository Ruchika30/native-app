# Native-app

This is a React Native application that has 4-5 screens which has been created as part of the assignment

1. Welcome page
2. Login page
3. Sign up page
4. Landing page
5. Explore page

The above application satifies the below points:
1. 3 views that can navigate between each other
2. 1 of those views must contain some form of input where data is captured and state kept
(and displayed) between each of the views
3. E.g. Welcome view where a user has to input their name. This can then be
displayed in the top right of every other view for the session.

4. 1 of those views must contain 4 variations of a button shown in the design. The last
variation of a button should provide slide event to perform action.
5. A native module integration leveraging the bridge that checks on startup whether the app
is running on an emulator/simulator. If so, display a notice to the user. The notice
message text and styling should be configurable through JS.
